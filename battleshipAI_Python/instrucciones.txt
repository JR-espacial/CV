BATTLESHIP INSTRUCTIONS (THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL DISAPPEAR IN 30 SECONDS)

Welcome to the game!!! Before we start it is important that you know the rules.

This game is a strategy game that emulates a naval battle between warships.
The game itself consists of two players facing each other and trying to guess where the enemy's ships are.
In this game you will play against the computer and each turn you will have an opportunity to shoot.
How do I start?
The first thing you should do is place your 5 ships first, the ship that occupies 5 squares
then the one with 4 then 2 ships of 3 and finally the ship of 2 place your ships strategically.
To place a ship you must do 2 clicks the first in the box where you want it to
start your ship and the second in a square netx to the first square you clicked in the direction you want it to be placed
 If the rest of the boat does not let you place it, it is because it does not fit in that orientation, try another.
After placing all your ships start shooting on the enemy board trying to guess
where are the enemy ships. The boxes will be colored according to what was in them
if you fail it will be colored blue if you hit the square it will be colored green and if you sink a ship all
 The ship will turn red if it does not turn red it means that you have not sunk it yet.

    Good luck !!!     The first to sink all 5 ships wins !!!!
